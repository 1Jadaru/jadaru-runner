## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

2. **Modern Web Browser** with WebGL support
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or download** this project to your local machine

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/snake
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will start a live server on `http://localhost:8080` and automatically open the game in your browser.

## Alternative Setup (Without Node.js)

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can still run the game:

1. **Serve the files** using any local web server:
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8080`
   - PHP: `php -S localhost:8080`
   - Or use any other local server solution

2. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with live reload
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality with ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting

## Game Controls

### Desktop
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **WASD Keys**: Alternative movement controls
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume game
- **R Key**: Restart game after game over

### Mobile
- **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe in the direction you want the snake to move
- **Tap Controls**: Tap the pause button to pause/resume

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer
2. **Scoring**: Each food item increases your score
3. **Collision**: Game ends if the snake hits walls or itself
4. **High Score**: Your best score is saved locally
