# LandlordOS Frontend Automated Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive automated testing strategy for the LandlordOS frontend application. The test plan covers all existing functionality and provides a framework for testing new features as they are developed.

## Testing Stack
- **Test Runner**: Vitest
- **React Testing**: React Testing Library
- **Assertions**: Jest DOM matchers
- **Mocking**: Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities
- **Coverage**: V8 coverage provider
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (to be added)

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Testing individual components, hooks, and utility functions in isolation.

### 2. Integration Tests
Testing the interaction between multiple components and services.

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Testing complete user workflows from start to finish.

### 4. Accessibility Tests
Ensuring the application meets WCAG accessibility standards.

### 5. Performance Tests
Monitoring component render times and bundle sizes.

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Component Testing Principles
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error states and edge cases
- Verify accessibility attributes

### 2. Integration Testing Approach
- Test complete user workflows
- Use realistic mock data
- Test data flow between components
- Verify side effects (API calls, state updates)

### 3. Mocking Strategy
- Mock API calls at the service layer
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for realistic responses
- Mock external libraries (date pickers, charts)
- Provide fallbacks for missing data

### 4. Accessibility Testing
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Check color contrast ratios
- Test focus management
- Validate ARIA attributes

## Performance Testing

### Bundle Size Monitoring
- Track bundle size changes
- Identify large dependencies
- Monitor code splitting effectiveness

### Component Performance
- Measure render times
- Test with large datasets
- Monitor memory usage
- Identify performance bottlenecks

## Continuous Integration

### Test Automation
- Run tests on every commit
- Generate coverage reports
- Block merges if tests fail
- Run different test suites based on changes

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All tests must pass
- No critical accessibility violations
- Bundle size within limits

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Strategy
- Realistic but anonymized data
- Consistent data relationships
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance test datasets

### Test Environment
- Isolated test database
- Consistent test state
- Easy data reset/cleanup
- Reproducible test conditions

## Reporting and Metrics

### Test Reports
- Coverage reports (HTML, JSON)
- Test execution results
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility audit results

### Monitoring
- Test execution time trends
- Flaky test identification
- Coverage trend analysis
- Performance regression detection

## Future Enhancements
