# LandlordOS Enterprise Migration - COMPLETE

## Migration Overview

LandlordOS has been successfully upgraded from a single-user application to a fully enterprise-ready platform supporting multi-user organizations, role-based access control, property assignments, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Completed Features

### 🏢 Multi-Organization Support
- **Organization Model**: Support for INDIVIDUAL, BUSINESS, and ENTERPRISE organization types
- **Organization Isolation**: All data is properly scoped to organizations
- **Tenant Data Migration**: All existing users and properties migrated to organization structure

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Hierarchical Roles**: ADMIN (100), MANAGER (50), AGENT (25), VIEWER (10)
- **Permission System**: 24 granular permissions across all modules
- **Role Inheritance**: Higher roles inherit lower role permissions
- **Dynamic Permission Checking**: Runtime permission validation

### 🏠 Property Assignment System
- **Flexible Assignments**: Users can be assigned specific properties or have full access
- **Assignment-Based Filtering**: Users only see assigned properties unless they have full access
- **Assignment Management**: ADMIN and MANAGER roles can manage property assignments

### 📋 Comprehensive Audit Trail
- **Action Logging**: All CRUD operations are automatically logged
- **User Attribution**: Every action tracks the user who performed it
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Precise timestamps for all audit events
- **Resource Tracking**: Links audit logs to specific resources (properties, tenants, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### Database Schema (Prisma)
```prisma
model Organization {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  type        OrganizationType @default(INDIVIDUAL)
  settings    Json?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  users       User[]
  properties  Property[]
  // ... other relations
}

model Role {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  level       Int    @unique
  permissions String[]
  
  userRoles   UserRole[]
}

model UserRole {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  roleId      String
  isActive    Boolean @default(true)
  assignedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  
  user        User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  role        Role @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([userId, roleId])
}

model Assignment {
  id         String @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  propertyId String
  assignedAt DateTime @default(now())
  assignedBy String
  
  user       User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  property   Property @relation(fields: [propertyId], references: [id])
  assignor   User     @relation("AssignedBy", fields: [assignedBy], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([userId, propertyId])
}

model AuditLog {
  id           String @id @default(cuid())
  action       String
  resourceType String
  resourceId   String?
  userId       String
  organizationId String
  metadata     Json?
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  
  user         User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  organization Organization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id])
}
```

#### Enterprise Authentication Middleware
- **JWT Token Validation**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Organization Context**: Automatic organization scoping
- **Permission Validation**: Middleware for route-level permission checks
- **Audit Logging**: Automatic logging of all authenticated actions

#### Updated API Routes
All major routes updated with enterprise features:
- `properties.js` - Property management with assignment filtering
- `tenants.js` - Tenant management with organization scoping
- `expenses.js` - Expense tracking with property access control
- `maintenance.js` - Maintenance requests with assignment validation
- `reminders.js` - Reminder system with permission checks
- `dashboard.js` - Dashboard with organization-scoped data
- `organization.js` - Organization and user management

### Frontend Changes

#### Enterprise Authentication Context
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  hasPermission: (permission: string) => boolean;
  hasRole: (roleName: string) => boolean;
  getHighestRole: () => Role | null;
  canAccessProperty: (propertyId: string) => boolean;
}
```

#### Permission System
- **Permission Constants**: 24 defined permissions in `constants/permissions.ts`
- **Permission Guards**: `PermissionGuard` component for conditional rendering
- **Permission Hooks**: `usePermissions` hook for navigation and action checks
- **Role Display**: Visual role and organization information

#### Updated Components
- **Properties Page**: Permission-based CRUD operations, property assignment filtering
- **Tenants Page**: Organization scoping, role-based access controls
- **Dashboard**: Organization context display, permission-aware metrics
- **Sidebar**: Permission-based navigation, organization/role display
- **Organization Page**: Team management, user invitations, role assignments

## Security Features
